### Running The Distance

Made for NMED3630 final project.

Running The Distance is a game based around exploration and documentation of your surroundings. Taking pictures further away from your home location earns you more kilometers! Try to collect as many as possible and enjoy the sights along the way!

The app is built using Framework7, and created with the Framework7 cli. It ulilizes the store for local storage.

Here are some features that I would like to add in the future to make the user experience better:
 - Prevent users from taking many pictures at the same location to load up on points
 - Provide rewards for acheiveing high scores. Like Acheivement badges, or group leaderboards
 - Allow the user to set their home location
 - Add user accounts
 - Use a proper database for persistant cloud storage
