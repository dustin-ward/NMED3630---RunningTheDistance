            <p>This app is a project developed for NMED3630 by Dustin Ward.</p>
            <p>
                Running The Distance is a game based around exploration and documentation of your 
                surroundings. Taking pictures further away from your home location earns you more 
                kilometers! Try to collect as many as possible and enjoy the sights along the way!

            <h2 class="outerglow-text">Future Development</h2>
            <p>Here are some features that I would like to add in the future to make the user experience better:</p>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Prevent users from taking many pictures at the same location to load up on points</li>
                <li>Provide rewards for acheiveing high scores. Like Acheivement badges, or group leaderboards</li>
                <li>Allow the user to set their home location</li>
            </ul>
